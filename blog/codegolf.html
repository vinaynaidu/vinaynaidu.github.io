<!--p>Working in startups can be great for so many reasons. You spend most of your time with a small group of people you trust, and you have a kind of freedom that working in a big corporations don't seem to offer. Working becomes fun, when the people you work with are wonderful and understanding.</p>

<p>Don't misread that, though; because working for startups is not easy - it requires a lot of involvement and means a lot of work. You are constantly required to put on multiple hats. One moment you are a developer working on a feature and the next you are a sys admin fixing a server that's suddenly unresponsive. You seamlesly go from a tester to developer to system architect and sometimes all in the same day</p-->

<p>At <a href="https://healthunlocked.com" target="_blank">HealthUnlocked</a>, sometimes we have the luxury of being able to spend some time away from work - a couple of hours, nothing significant. We come together with the most simplest of ideas, and each developer takes that simple idea and make something out of it. Here, I detail those sessions and what came of it.</p>

<h4>1. FizzBuzz</h4>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" target="_blank">FizzBuzz</a> is an extremely simple idea. You print N numbers, and every time the number is divisible by 3, it's replaced with Fizz. Every time it's divisible by 5, Buzz is printed of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print FizzBuzz. The whole code can be simply summed up in javascript in a few lines: </p>

<pre>
for(var i=0; i<20; i++) 
    if(i%5 == 0 && i%3 ==0) 
        console.log("FizzBuzz")        
    else if (i%5==0) 
        console.log("Buzz") 
    else if (i%3==0) 
        console.log("Fizz") 
    else 
        console.log(i);
</pre>

<p>This simplicity of the code is exactly what makes it an interesting idea. There are so many posibilities that could come out of it. Of course, just doing exactly what I did above with javascript, while tecnically correct, would be too easy and boring, so I wanted to get a bit creative with it.</p>

<p>I had been playing around with <a href="http://paperjs.org/" target="_blank">paper.js</a> for a while and when I was told we'd be having a fizzbuzz codegolf, I started thinking of ways to code something fun using paper.js. Here's what I finally ended up doing. Take a picture - any picture. Analyze the picture pixel by pixel, and calculate how close to being black the pixel is. AKA how much "black" is in the pixel. A pixel with #000 would have a 100% blackness factor, while #fff would have 0%. Do you see what I am getting at, yet? So I take each pixel, put make it blue if it's divisible by 3, red if it's divisible by 5, and purple if divisible by both 3 and 5. This turned out to be a very bad idea - more because I chose a really large picture of monalisa to process, initially. After some trial and error, I ended up resizing the image within the canvas and grouping a set of pixels. Take a group of 10x10 pixels, calculate the collective blackness factor in the group and apply the same logic.</p>

<p>The final code, and the image, can be <a href="http://vinaynaidu.github.io/codegolf/fizzbuzz/" target="_blank">viewed here</a>. The page is best viewed at some distance. The size of the rendered circles are proportional to the blackness factor. The darker the pixels are, the larger they are drawn. Even so, the page has to be viewed at least at arm's legth to see the monalisa behind all the circles!</p>

<p><sub>My favourite submission of the day was from Aaron - The letters "FIZZBUZZ" dance up and down on the screen, with the word "FIZZ" forming at every 3 seconds, "BUZZ" forming at every 5, and "FIZZBUZZ" forming at every 15. Have a <a href="http://aaronlecompte.github.io/fbuzz" target="_blank">look at it here</a>.</sub></p>

<h4>2. Conway's game of life</h4>

<p>Conway's game of life is another simple idea that I had a lot of fun coding. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> puts it, it's a simple cellular automation based on 4 rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
	<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
	<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
	<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, it's a 2x2 matrix with binary values, representing the state of the cell, viz dead or alive. With each iteration, the new value of each row-col position of the matrix is recalculated with the above rules in mind. And, since I already had some experience with paper.js, and, because the best way to represent this would be visually, instead of just printing out matrix states, I went ahead with the javascript route, yet again.</p>

<p>Once the code was up and running, I had a few more minutes to spare, so I added in a "heatmap", of sorts, to the game. The cell starts off with a green state, and the longer it lives, the close to red it gets. First generation is green and upto 5 different colours of the heatmap, the cell goes from green to yellow to orange to red. This way, I could see which cells are continuing on to next generation easily.</p>

<p>The live example of my game of life <a href="http://vinaynaidu.github.io/codegolf/game-of-life/" target="_blank">is here</a>.</p>

<sub>The other example that I really liked from this codegolf session was by Alex - a game of life <a href="http://alextrofymenko.github.io/checkbox-of-life/" target="_blank">with checkboxes!</a></sub>
